## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [SCSS(sass)](https://sass-lang.com/) v1.57
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) v18.2 - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) v6.6
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) v1.10

### What I learned

- Will update later
### Continued development

- Routing this current project was routing so bad and messy, so i want to level it up to something clear, easy to read and contain in one place to make it easy to keep track
- Make og tag so when I share it they will know what website talk about
- Change sass to tailwind because I think sass take more time than use tailwind and it make me so much time to name some element just for styling it

### Useful resources

- [React router tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) - Good to learn react router when you don't have any experience.
